# Question

Every $n^{\text{th}}$ Fibonacci number is even. What is $n$?

# Solution

Fibonacci Numbers
: The *Fibonacci sequence*, is the sequence of numbers such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.

That is

$F_{0} = 0, F_{1} = 1$

and

$F_{n} = F_{n − 1} + F_{n − 2}$

for $n > 1$. 

First, consider the following sums. 

$\text{Even} + \text{Odd} = 2n + (2m + 1) = 2(n+m) + 1 = \text{Odd}$

$\text{Even} + \text{Even} = 2n + 2m = 2(n+m) = \text{Even}$

$\text{Odd} + \text{Odd} = (2n + 1) + (2m + 1) = 2(n+m) + 2 = 2(n + m + 1) = \text{Even}$

Now we look at the first few Fibonacci number to see if we can find a pattern

$0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,\ldots$

or

$-,O,O,E,O,O,E,O,\ldots$

We can see the pattern develop. It will always be the following additions which form the sequence

$\text{Odd} + \text{Odd} = \text{Even}, \text{Even} + \text{Odd} = \text{Odd}, \text{Odd} + \text{Even} = \text{Odd}, \text{Odd} + \text{Odd} = \text{Even}, \ldots$

Therefore, ever **third** Fibonacci number will be even.
