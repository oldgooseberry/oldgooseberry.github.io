This section contains the solutions to the problems which were posted. I will try to keep up with the solutions here. I will wait a few days to a week to post.

Ok, so working on a few for the geometry problems I have realized I have no good way to mark up the drawings to "show" work. So... I fake it using a drawing tool over the image. I am not an artist. Some of them suck.

> *Note: Sometimes there is more than one approach to the problem solution. I have provided one or more of them. If you think you have another, ask me and lets see if it is correct. If it is, I will add it to the solutions.*
