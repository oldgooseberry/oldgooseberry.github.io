# Question

If $54$ is divided into three parts that are proportional to 2, 3, and 4, what is the largest part?

# Solution

We look to divide the number 54 into three parts which are proportional to $2:3:4$. That is, we seek a value $n$ such that $2\cdot n + 3 \cdot n + 4 \cdot n = 54$. There are several ways to approach this. The first is to simply solve this equation

$\begin{align}
2\cdot n + 3 \cdot n + 4 \cdot n &= 54 \\
(2 + 3 + 4) \cdot n &= 54 \\
9n &= 54 \\
n &= 6 \\
\end{align}$

Therefore the largest part is $4 \cdot n = 4 \cdot 6 = 24$

The second is to simply search the space for an integer solution. To do this, we could just run some integers to see if this will work or until we exceed the value $54$

```julia
julia> for n in 1:10
       println("$(2*n + 3*n + 4*n)")
       end
9
18
27
36
45
54
63
72
81
90
```

Which we see will happen when $n = 6$. Therefore the largest part is $4 \cdot n = 4 \cdot 6 = 24$
