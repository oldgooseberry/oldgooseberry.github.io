# Question

![](/img/jan2020/box1.png)

If the area of the the square $ABCD$ is $36$, what is the perimeter of $ABCDE$

# Solution

If the area of the square is $36$, then we know the length of the sides 

$\overline{AB} = \overline{BC} = \overline{CD} = \overline{DA} = \sqrt{36} = 6$

but we know 

$\overline{AB} = \overline{BC} = \overline{CD} = \overline{DA} = \overline{DE} = \overline{EA}$

Thus the perimeter is 

$6 \times 5 = 30$
