# Question

$ 33 \times .5454545454\ldots $

# Solution

We can solve this problem by recalling the method for converting a repeating decimal into a fraction (as all repeating decimals are fractoins or rationals numbers). The process goes like this. Find the grouping of repeating decimals. Count the digits and multiply the number by 

$10^{\text{number of digits}}$

in our case, the digits repeat after $2$ so we will multiply the number by

$10^{2} = 100$

So we can write the following equations

{% raw %}{::nomarkdown}<div>
$\begin{align*}
x &= .5454545454\ldots \\
100x &= 54.5454545454\ldots \\
\therefore \\
100x - x &= 54.5454545454\ldots - .5454545454\ldots \\
99x &= 54 \\
x &= \frac{54}{99} = \frac{6}{11}
\end{align*}$
</div>{:/}{% endraw %}

But then

$33 \times .5454545454\ldots = 33 \times \frac{6}{11} = 18$
