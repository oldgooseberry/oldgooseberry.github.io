# Solution

We have added labels to 6 key angles in the figure. The points which form the corner of these angles lie on either the small or large circle and at the intersection of the larger triangle with the smaller. These points form inscribed quadrilaterals. Why is this interesting, it turns out that for inscribed quadrilaterals, we know the sum of opposite angles is $180°$ (see below for why - am adding this later). Given this and the angles $\angle{CAB} = 55$ and $\angle{ABD} = 70$, we know that 

$\angle{DCA} = 180 - \angle{ABD} = 180 - 70 = 110$ 

and 

$\angle{BDC} = 180 - \angle{CAB} = 180 - 55 = 125$

But, we can then compute the angles $\angle{ECD}$ and $\angle{CDF}$ as these are the supplementary angles to $\angle{DCA}$ and $\angle{BDC}$ respectively. This means

$\angle{ECD} = 180 - \angle{DCA} = 180 - 110 = 70$

and

$\angle{CDF} = 180 - \angle{BDC} = 180 - 125 = 55$

Again, we can use the fact that the quadrilateral $FECD$ is inscribed by the smaller circle to find the angle $\angle{DFE}$

$\angle{DFE} = 180 - \angle{ECD} = 180 - 70 = 110$

But now we know two of the three angles of the smaller triangle, they are

$\angle{?DF} = 55$

and 

$\angle{DFE} = 110$

Therefore

$\angle{F?D} = 180 - (55 + 110) = 180 - 165 = 15$

Proof that the sum of opposite angles of and inscribed quadrilateral are $180°$

Three parts
Will get to this..
