# Question

What is the $y$-intercept

![](/img/jan2020/graph1.png)

# Solution

We are given two points. With these and the definition of the slope of a line

$ \text{slope} = m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{y_{2} - y_{1}}{x_{2} - x_{1}} $

we can derive the equation of the line by writing

{% raw %}{::nomarkdown}<div>
$\begin{align*}
 \frac{y - y_{1}}{x - x_{1}} &=  \frac{y_{2} - y_{1}}{x_{2} - x_{1}} \\
 \frac{y - 0}{x - (-7)} &=  \frac{6 - 0}{-5 - (-7)} \\
 \frac{y}{x + 7} &=  \frac{6}{-5 + 7} \\
 \frac{y}{x + 7} &=  \frac{6}{2} \\
 \frac{y}{x + 7} &=  3 \\
 y &=  3(x + 7) \\
 y &=  3x + 21 \\
\end{align*}$
</div>{:/}{% endraw %}

This equation is now in the canonical form

$y = mx + b$

Where the slope is $m$ and the $y$-intercept is $b$. So the $y$-intercept = $21$
