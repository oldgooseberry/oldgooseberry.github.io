# Question

How many different paths can a ball dropped from the top take to reach the bottom?

![](/img/jan2020/jan16.png)

# Solution

At each point on the graph (top to bottom) we have a choice, we can move left (L) or right (R). For the first layers, the possible paths are

| Layer | Paths |
|---    | ---   |
| 1     | L<br/>R |
| 2     | LL<br>LR<br/>RL<br/>RR |

For each layer, we get the layer number of path points and two possible values for each point. We can think of this like a binary number of n-bits. So for the graph given, we are at a depth of 4. Therefore, in our model, we have a string of 4 bits. The number of unique 4 bit strings is $2^{4} = 16$
