# Question

Set $A$ has 20 elements. Set $B$ has 21 elements. $\vert A \cap B \vert = 13$. What is $\vert A \cup B \vert$?

# Solution

The elements of  $A \cup B$ are all the elements of $A$ and $B$. However, we do not want to double count the things in both $A$ and $B$, $A \cap B$. Therefore

$\vert A \cup B \vert = \vert A \vert + \vert B \vert - \vert A \cup B \vert$

and so

$\vert A \cup B \vert = 20 + 21 - 13 = 28$
