# Question

What is the second prime number of the form

$W_{n} = n \cdot 2^{n} - 1$


# Solution

To solve this is it simple to iterate $n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$ until we find the second prime number. A simple `julia` program to do this would be

```julia
julia> for n in 1:10
       println("$(n*2^n-1)")
       end
1
7
23
63
159
383
895
2047
4607
10239
```

From which we see $n = 3 \rightarrow W_{3} = 23$ is the second prime number.
