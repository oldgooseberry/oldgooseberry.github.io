# Question

Avery arrives at a coffee shop at a random time between 7:00 and 9:00. and Bruno at a random time between 6:00 and 10:00. The arrival times are independant.

What is the probability that Bruno arrives at least $\frac{1}{2}$hr after Avery?


# Solution

One way to think about this problem is in the form of a graph

When the problem is considered in this way, the probability of Bruno arriving at least $\frac{1}{2}$hr after Avery is the ratio of the total area of the rectangle created by the arrival time of Bruno and arrival time of Avery

{% raw %}{::nomarkdown}<div>
$\begin{align*}
(\Delta \text{Avery Arrival Time}) \times (\Delta \text{Bruno Arrival Time}) &= \\
(9 -7) \times (10 - 6) &= \\
2 \times 4 &= 8 \\
\end{align*}$
</div>{:/}{% endraw %}

and the area in red (all possible times Bruno can arrive $\frac{1}{2}$hr after Avery).

{% raw %}{::nomarkdown}<div>
$\begin{align*}
(\text{Area of red rectangle}) + (\text{Area of red triangle}) &= \\
(\frac{1}{2} \cdot 2) + (\frac{1}{2} \cdot 2 \cdot 2) &= \\
1 + 2 &= 3 \\
\end{align*}$
</div>{:/}{% endraw %}

This ratio is

$\frac{3}{8}$

That is, if we randomly select a point from all times in the area of arrival times, the probability of selecting a point in the red region (Bruno arrives at least $\frac{1}{2}$hr after Avery) is

$\frac{3}{8} \approx 37.5\% $
