We have added the label $\alpha$ for the length of a side we will use in the solution. We have also labled two sets of angles which are congruent.

> *Note: Why are the two sets of angles congruent? If you do not see it, ask me about it.*

Based on the above and the properties of similar triangles, we can write

$$\frac{x}{1} = \frac{?}{\alpha}$$

Solving for the unknown we are interested in we get

$$\begin{equation}? = x \alpha \label{eq_1} \end{equation}$$

We now need to find an expression for $\alpha$ in terms of $x, y$ and/or $z$. To do this, we work with the similar triangles around the diagonal line. Using these we can write

$$\frac{z}{1} = \frac{\alpha}{y}$$

Solving for $\alpha$ we get

$$\begin{equation}\alpha = yz\label{eq_2} \end{equation}$$

Now, using \eqref{eq_1} and \eqref{eq_2} we can solve for the unknown and get

$$? = xyz$$
