This site was written to provide solutions to some posed math questions. The issue was posting this in a place which was easy for anyone to access, as well as being easy to post to. I have no interest in spending time writing tons of HTML. I would rather spend my time writing the solutions to these problems. To that end, I tend to use [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) with the [math extensions](https://rawgit.com/fletcher/MultiMarkdown-6-Syntax-Guide/master/index.html) (really MultiMarkdown). 

For some of the solutions posted, it is nice to have access to a computer algebra system ([CAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_computer_algebra_systems)) to experiment or for the actual solution. There is a service which offers a low end system for free (as in beer). This service is provided by the same group responsible for the powerful CAS [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/). You can find the pricing page [here](https://cocalc.com/policies/pricing.html) and work through the registration. There are, of course, limits. But these will not be an issue for problems here. When using this, or a similar service, I tend to post code in the [`julia`](https://julialang.org/) language using the `sympy` library. You can do the same using `SymPy` in [`python`](https://www.python.org/) I am just not as much a fan of it. The interface presented by this and other services is called [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/).

> ***Disclaimer***: I do not claim here or anywhere on this site that I created or originaly posed any of these questions. There are so many sources out there with good vetted questions (have sane answers). I do not have the time or energy to create tons of new questions with solutions and make sure they can be solved.

Oh, and you learn this at the worst time because you waited till the exam was in progress to create the solution guide. Yeah, no fun at all. I am older now, and maybe a bit wiser. Or just lazy, who can say.
