    "content": "This site was written to provide solutions to some posed math questions. The issue was posting this in a place which was easy for anyone to access, as well as being easy to post to. I have no interest in spending time writing tons of HTML. I would rather spend my time writing the solutions to these problems. To that end, I tend to use Markdown with the math extensions (really MultiMarkdown). . For some of the solutions posted, it is nice to have access to a computer algebra system (CAS) to experiment or for the actual solution. There is a service which offers a low end system for free (as in beer). This service is provided by the same group responsible for the powerful CAS SageMath. You can find the pricing page here and work through the registration. There are, of course, limits. But these will not be an issue for problems here. When using this, or a similar service, I tend to post code in the julia language using the sympy library. You can do the same using SymPy in python I am just not as much a fan of it. The interface presented by this and other services is called Jupyter. . . Disclaimer: I do not claim here or anywhere on this site that I created or originaly posed any of these questions. There are so many sources out there with good vetted questions (have sane answers). I do not have the time or energy to create tons of new questions with solutions and make sure they can be solved. . If you have never done this, I have, and it can be no fun to pose a question for an exam only to find out you can not solve it. Oh, and you learn this at the worst time because you waited till the exam was in progress to create the solution guide. Yeah, no fun at all. I am older now, and maybe a bit wiser. Or just lazy, who can say. .",

    "content": "Question . It is possible to write the number $2020$ as the difference of two squares . $2020 = 106^{2} - 96^{2}$ . is there any other way to write $2020$ as the difference of two squares? . Solution . If we spend a few minutes thinking about the wording of this problem, we might eventually hit on the phrase “difference of two squares”. From Algebra, what do this mean exactly. This means we have something like . $A^{2} - B^{2}$ . But, we know something about expressions which look like this. That is, we can factor these expressions as . $(A - B)(A + B)$ . This means our question is really asking, can we write . $A^{2} - B^{2} = (A - B)(A + B) = 2020$ . in some way other than . $2020 = 106^{2} - 96^{2}$ . This means we are looking for $A$ and $B$ such that $(A - B)$ and $(A + B)$ are factors of $2020$. To that end, the first thing to do is look at the factors of $2020$. Factoring we get . $2020 = 2^{2} cdot 5 cdot 101$ . This means we need to solve equations like . $ begin{align*} A + B &amp;= (101)(2) = 202 A - B &amp;= (5)(2) = 10 end{align*}$ . We know $A + B$ is bigger than $A - B$ so we know the factor $A + B$ will always use at least the factor $101$. Looking at the number of factors and the previous fact, there are only $5$ different sets of equations to check. Lets work the first set and see if we get any hints that will make checking the $5$ faster. We will solve the first equation of $A$ and substitute this into the second equation and solve for $B$ . $ begin{align*} A + B &amp;= 202 rightarrow A = 202 - B qquad qquad (1) A - B &amp;= 10 202 - B - B &amp;= 10 -2B &amp;= 10 - 202 -2B &amp;= -192 qquad qquad qquad qquad qquad : (2) B &amp;= 96 rightarrow A = 202 - 96 = 106 end{align*}$ . First, this is the solution we were given to begin with. Next, it becomes clear that in each subsequent pair of equations, we are going to end up with an expression of the form . $-2B = ( text{first constant}) - ( text{second constant})$ . There can not be an integer solution to this set of equations unless the difference is even. So we can take a short cut an simply look at all the differences. . $ begin{align*} 101 - 20 &amp;= 81 leftarrow text{Not integer solutions} 404 - 5 &amp;= 399 leftarrow text{Not integer solutions} 505 - 4 &amp;= 501 leftarrow text{Not integer solutions} 1010 - 2 &amp;= 1008 leftarrow textbf{VALID!} end{align*}$ . So there is one more solution to the problem. Looking back at $(1)$ and $(2)$, we can quickly solve to find . $ begin{align*} -2B &amp;= -1008 B &amp;= 504 rightarrow A = 1010 - 504 = 506 end{align*}$ . Therefore there are two different pair of integers such that the difference of their squares is $2020$ . $ begin{align*} 2020 &amp;= 106^{2} - 96^{2} 2020 &amp;= 506^{2} - 504^{2} end{align*}$ .",

    "content": "Question . What is the smallest prime factor of $10^{101} + 1$ . Solution . We want to look for a pattern in the factorization of . To this end, we look at the values and factorization for $1 leq n leq 10$. A simple julia program to do this is . julia&gt; for i in 1:10 println(&quot;$(BigInt(10)^i + 1) = $( factor(Set, BigInt(10)^i + 1) )&quot;) end 11 = Set(BigInt[11]) 101 = Set(BigInt[101]) 1001 = Set(BigInt[7, 13, 11]) 10001 = Set(BigInt[137, 73]) 100001 = Set(BigInt[11, 9091]) 1000001 = Set(BigInt[101, 9901]) 10000001 = Set(BigInt[11, 909091]) 100000001 = Set(BigInt[17, 5882353]) 1000000001 = Set(BigInt[7, 52579, 13, 19, 11]) 10000000001 = Set(BigInt[3541, 101, 27961]) . We see there is a pattern developing. For $n$ odd, the smallest prime factor is $11$. For $n$ even, we can not say anything about the smallest prime factor. Since we were asking about and $101$ is odd, then $11$ is the smallest prime factor. . A more Algebraic (and complete) solution to this problem can be found by noting the following relationships . $ begin{split} x^3 + 1 &amp;= (x+1)(x^{2} - x + 1) x^5 + 1 &amp;= (x+1)(x^{4} - x^{3} + x^{2} - x + 1) x^7 + 1 &amp;= (x+1)(x^{6} - x^{5} + x^{4} - x^{3} + x^{2} - x + 1) vdots x^{101} + 1 &amp;= (x+1)(x^{100} - x^{99} + x^{98} - ldots + x^{6} - x^{5} + x^{4} - x^{3} + x^{2} - x + 1) end{split}$ . That is, for $n$ odd, $x^{n} + 1$ can be factored as . Now let $x = 10$ and get the relationship . . Note: Never discount using a tool like a CAS to explore the “shape” of the problem. This can often point you in the direction of a more formal or exact solution/proof. Math actually can be a very experimental experience, though rarely enough is this shown. . Exploring factoing in julia can be acomplished by doing the following (this assumes the SymPy module has not been built or loaded into your julia enviroment if you are using the suggested service skip the first command(s)) . julia&gt; using Pkg; Pkg.add(&quot;SymPy&quot;); using SymPy &lt;LOTS OF STUFF HERE&gt; julia&gt; @vars x (x,) julia&gt; factor(x^3 + 1) ⎛ 2 ⎞ (x + 1)⋅⎝x - x + 1⎠ julia&gt; factor(x^5 + 1) ⎛ 4 3 2 ⎞ (x + 1)⋅⎝x - x + x - x + 1⎠ julia&gt; factor(x^7 + 1) ⎛ 6 5 4 3 2 ⎞ (x + 1)⋅⎝x - x + x - x + x - x + 1⎠ julia&gt; factor(x^4 + 1) 4 x + 1 julia&gt; factor(x^6 + 1) ⎛ 2 ⎞ ⎛ 4 2 ⎞ ⎝x + 1⎠⋅⎝x - x + 1⎠ julia&gt; factor(x^8 + 1) 8 x + 1 julia&gt; .",
